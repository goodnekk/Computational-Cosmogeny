A conversation
==============

A [conversation](mapping/conversation.md) about computation and cosmogeny between `af` & `mg`

* {`mg`: So, what are we actually trying to do here?}
* {`af`: I think we are picking up from were people thinking about computers in the 60s left, because now the web as a medium and as a [material](mapping/material.md) to build things has evolved so much you can actually implement those ideas, imo}
* {`mg`: Okay let's start from there. I think in 60s counterculture there are several lines of thought that come together. It's interesting that as a movement it happened between the 'end' of Modernity and the 'rise' of Post-Modernity in the 80s. [Hippie modernists](mapping/hippie-modernism.md) seem to be in this [in-between](mapping/meta.md) state where there is a yearning for a kind of techno-utopian future, but at the same time an awareness of the ecological and perhaps a rejection of the idea of technology as progress. Computers and the web bind all this together. Up until that point computation was seen as a tool of centralized power. A lot of the 60s design and architecture is focussed on this idea of 'democratizing' tools, perhaps as a way of self-sufficiency, or maybe as a form of resistance.}
* {`af`: ...}
