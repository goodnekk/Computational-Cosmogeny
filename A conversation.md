A conversation
==============

A [conversation](mapping/conversation.md) about computation and cosmogeny between `af` & `mg`

* `mg`: So, what are we actually trying to do here?
* `af`: I think we are picking up from were people thinking about computers in the 60s left, because now the web as a medium and as a [material](mapping/material.md) to build things has evolved so much you can actually implement those ideas, imo
* `mg`: Okay let's start from there. I think in 60s counterculture there are several lines of thought that come together. It's interesting that as a movement it happened between the 'end' of Modernity and the 'rise' of Post-Modernity in the 80s. [Hippie modernists](mapping/hippie-modernism.md) seem to be in this [in-between](mapping/meta.md) state where there is a yearning for a kind of techno-utopian future, but at the same time an awareness of the ecological and perhaps a rejection of the idea of technology as progress. Computers and the web bind all this together. Up until that point computation was seen as a tool of centralized power. A lot of the 60s design and architecture is focussed on this idea of 'democratizing' tools, perhaps as a way of self-sufficiency, or maybe as a form of resistance.
* `af`: For some reasons my mind was mostly attracted to this era because of many technical experiments that then never took  shape and for the most part were shadowed (or abandoned) by the rising of the Personal Computer as an office appliance; the rhetoric of simplifying programmers tools into white-collar application, etc. It’s good though that you opened up already the conversation to a larger scale, so we can move between other things. Therefore, I will re-open up the center point of cybernetics discourse from an [article by Luciana Parisi](https://technosphere-magazine.hkw.de/p/27b96c50-1708-11e7-8e2c-df8794815e93) (full notes on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/block/1528154)):
	* > For critical posthumanism, the accelerated investment into intelligent machines has led to the formation of a posthuman subjectivity that acts without reasoning. This subjectivity has left behind reflective thinking and the slow pace of consciousness in favor of the immediacy of data correlation and the chain effects of fast decisions. *According to Hayles, this automated form of non-conscious intelligence involves the capacity of machines to solve complex problems without using formal languages or inferential deductive reasoning. However, rather than appealing to consciousness as the dividing line of human from machine cognition, Hayles’ argument draws on a more general articulation of co-causal interactions across the non-conscious intelligences of animals, humans, and machines.* This extended vision of cognition enables a tripartite architecture of material processes (such as organic and artificial neural structures), non-conscious (such as non-reflexive or effect-led reasoning), and conscious (such as causal tracking, meta-reasoning, logical consequences) cognition. Whilst the materiality of process remains an inescapable starting point for thinking, the latter is not simply a tout court manifestation of these processes, but is mediated by a general activity of information-processing tasks, leading to outputs or results with the minimum effort of logical reasoning.
