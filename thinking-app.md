## intro

I came to think that we need real hypertext to work proficiently and with different level of degrees in the complexity of our thinking.

And I feel that hypertext has not been really implemented so far (I dare not to say it hasn't been explored though, HTML is very good and Xanadu is very beyond).

The best you can get from a native OS app with a file system, is to link from within a text note to another text now â€” usually using a wiki-style syntax, eg `[[another document]]`.

While this is nice, it shows how much contemporary personal computing has been stuck with the office-paper-folder metaphor: if you don't print it, it does not exists.

Whenever you place a browser to link together different html documents, then one or more parts of the workflow suffer from sup-optimal tool (eg, collaborative writing). Whenever there is an effort to setup a really networked system, you suddenly get the feeling of being drawn back to use other piece of softwares outside that environment and move materials around by copy pasting, duplicating or moving files, and so forth.

Rather than building an entire workflow in the browser, I wonder if it's not more a matter of channelling one material to multiple outputs (which might not be its final outcome), and moreover, laying the whole workflow foundation upon a networking system that is made to work non-unilaterally, and instead infinitely collaboratively. For example, from an http-based client-server setup, to a dat peer 2 peer based setup.

All this to say that I have never felt my computing experience as really being networked, also when using file-sharing services like dropbox, or solid wiki software like MediaWiki.

What I'm gonna sketch out in the following text, is a note-taking and mind-mapping system, part of a larger experiment in building a wiki on top of the dat protocol.
