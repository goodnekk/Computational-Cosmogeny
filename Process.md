Reading >> Collecting >> Relating >> Writing >>
===============================================

When I think about my process of thinking, I could describe it as having the following steps.

- Reading(Input): "Taking-in" Articles, Books, Film, Images etc.

- Collecting: Some of the content I find interesting, I highlight paragraphs or sections.

- Relating: I mentally relate these "ideas" to other, similar/contrasting ideas, that I have previously formed. This is where different "types" of thinking come in:
	- Deduction(a therefor b)
	- Induction(a therefor possibly b)
	- Abduction(a because probably b)
	- Divergent thinking(Relating two unrelated ideas)
	- Transversal thinking(Relating outside of conceptual barriers)
	- ...

- Writing(Output): I externalise these thoughts in linguistic/visual form. So that others may "Read" it (Including myself at some later point, i.e. note-taking)


## Tools
- Reading/Writing: written language, diagrams, photographpy, sketches.... "media"
- Collecting: Keeping open tabs, Bookmarking, Highlight Markers, Scribbles in the margin
- Relating: Collections (Are.na), Mindmaps, Indexing(Index Cards, Search),

I think we can probably do a whole lot better in the sections of Collecting and Relating.
- Why can't I bookmark a phrase in a webpage?
- I can only put whole things into collections, but not relate smaller sections of things in more subtle ways..
- My highlights in paper books are stuck in paper form.
- My notebook is stuck in a "page" model, where I can only ever start with a blank slate, not build on previous ideas without distroying the previous thoughts.
