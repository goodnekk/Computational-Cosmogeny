Reading >> Collecting >> Relating >> Writing >>
===============================================

When I think about my process of thinking, I could describe it as having the following steps.

- Reading (Input): "Taking-in" Articles, Books, Film, Images etc.

- Collecting: Some of the content I find interesting, I highlight paragraphs or sections.

- Relating: I mentally relate these "ideas" to other, similar/contrasting ideas, that I have previously formed. This is where different "types" of thinking come in:
	- Deduction (a therefor b)
	- Induction (a therefor possibly b)
	- Abduction (a because probably b)
	- Divergent thinking (Relating two unrelated ideas)
	- Transversal thinking (Relating outside of conceptual barriers)
	- ...

- Writing (Output): I externalise these thoughts in linguistic/visual form. So that others may "Read" it (Including myself at some later point, i.e. note-taking)

## Tools

- Reading/Writing: written language, diagrams, photography, sketches... "media"
- Collecting: Keeping open tabs, Bookmarking, Highlight Markers, Scribbles in the margin
- Relating: Collections (Are.na), Mindmaps, Indexing (Index Cards, Search),

I think we can probably do a whole lot better in the sections of Collecting and Relating.
- Why can't I highlight and bookmark a phrase in a webpage? 
	{af: what do you mean you can't? having a reference link to specifically it, like a line number on github?}
	{mg: as in, why can't I treat webpages the same way I treat books: highlight and scribble in the margins, stick post-it's}

- I can only put whole things into collections, but not relate things in more subtle ways.
	{af: examples would be useful to this, also this reminds me of [Are.na's flat ontology](https://www.are.na/desmond-wong/flat-ontology-arena) suggestion and Teddy's trasnclusion ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion)) ideas [eg xanadu](http://xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html)}
	{mg: this has everything to do with the notion of [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_(mathematical_logic)) ([Structure](https://www.archdaily.com/610531/frei-otto-and-the-importance-of-experimentation-in-architecture) [in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cosmic_structures) [the](https://leanderherzog.ch/higgsboson/) [widest](http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) [sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holarchy) [possible](http://en.bp.ntu.edu.tw/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/06-Alexander-A-city-is-not-a-tree.pdf)).

- My highlights in paper books are stuck in paper form 
	{af: I'd be really curious to test out a scanning system that beside convert images to text would also detect highlighted text within certain set parameters}
	{mg: I've been experimenting with a simple OCR thing on my phone. Basically instead of highlighting with a pen, I just scan the section and save it in a textfile. Not ideal though}

- My notebook is stuck in a "page" model, where I can only ever start with a blank slate, not build on previous ideas without destroying the previous thoughts 
	{af: this is very true, and the problem generally lies within the notebook format though (which is beautiful but for portability reasons it's *linear*);}
	{mg: I've tried using index-cards as a way of re-ordering things before. Might be a good to re-try :)}


## Meta
{mg: what are we actually trying to do here? writing a text, having a [conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory), or [both](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus).}
