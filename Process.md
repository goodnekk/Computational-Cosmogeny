Reading >> Collecting >> Relating >> Writing >>
===============================================

When I think about my process of thinking, I could describe it as having the following steps.

- Reading (Input): "Taking-in" Articles, Books, Film, Images etc.

- Collecting: Some of the content I find interesting, I highlight paragraphs or sections.

- Relating: I mentally relate these "ideas" to other, similar/contrasting ideas, that I have previously formed. This is where different "types" of thinking come in:
	- Deduction (a therefor b)
	- Induction (a therefor possibly b)
	- Abduction (a because probably b)
	- Divergent thinking (Relating two unrelated ideas)
	- Transversal thinking (Relating outside of conceptual barriers)
	- ...

- Writing (Output): I externalise these thoughts in linguistic/visual form. So that others may "Read" it (Including myself at some later point, i.e. note-taking)

## Tools

- Reading/Writing: written language, diagrams, photography, sketches... "media"
- Collecting: Keeping open tabs, Bookmarking, Highlight Markers, Scribbles in the margin
- Relating: Collections (Are.na), Mindmaps, Indexing (Index Cards, Search),

I think we can probably do a whole lot better in the sections of Collecting and Relating.
- Why can't I bookmark a phrase in a webpage? {what do you mean you can't? having a reference link to specifically it, like a line number on github?}
- I can only put whole things into collections, but not relate smaller sections of things in more subtle ways {examples would be useful to this, also this reminds me of [Are.na's flat ontology](https://www.are.na/desmond-wong/flat-ontology-arena) suggestion and Teddy's trasnclusion ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion)) ideas [eg xanadu](http://xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html)}
- My highlights in paper books are stuck in paper form {I'd be really curious to test out a scanning system that beside convert images to text would also detect highlighted text within certain set parameters}
- My notebook is stuck in a "page" model, where I can only ever start with a blank slate, not build on previous ideas without destroying the previous thoughts {this is very true, and the problem generally lies within the notebook format though (which is beautiful but for portability reasons it's *linear*);}
