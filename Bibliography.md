Papers and books with short summaries

## Metadesign

- [Metadesign - Maturana](http://www.digitalcultures.org/Library/Maturana_Metadesign.pdf)
- [Meta-design: A Framework for the Future of End-User Development](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-5386-X_19) - Designing open systems, Design for evolution, merging design- and use-time, end-user development, turing tar pit, level of representation. Information and functionality represented in closed systems can never be complete because the world changes, new requirements emerge and people change their work practices over time. Developing environments that allow the “owners of problems” to create the solutions themselves at use time. Consumer-Designer Spectrum, migration path towards designer.

## Programming

- [Subject-Oriented Programming (A Critique of Pure Objects)](http://ivizlab.sfu.ca/arya/Papers/SW/SOP.pdf) - Critiques the fact that objects in OO are a "universal" description of an entity, and proposes a system where objects have unique identifiers, but can have different properties for different subjects or observers. 

## Structures

- [A State of Art Survey on zz-structures](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/83a6/fd1e0e7fbcaa94291a35371bc0f303ab6f21.pdf?_ga=2.110854853.1305587070.1527691897-1693572663.1527691897) - An overview of different applications and programming tools using zz-structures. Contains a large amount of references to other papers.
- [A Comparison of Hyperstructures: Zzstructures, mSpaces, and Polyarchies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221267239_A_Comparison_of_Hyperstructures_Zzstructures_mSpaces_and_Polyarchies) - Analysis of different constrained graph structures from a graph-theory perspective

## IBIS
- [Why Horst W.J. Rittel Matters](http://www.dubberly.com/articles/why-horst-wj-rittel-matters.html) - A good summary of Horst Rittels work; first generation design methods v.s. second generation design methods.
- [glBIS: A Hypertext Tool for Exploratory Policy Discussion](http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS835/Readings/p303-conklin_gibis.pdf)


## Mapping & Diagrams

- [Statecharts: A visual formalism for complex systems](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf)
- [How easily understandable are complex multi-layered system maps](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132316653.pdf) - A study on the usability of complex interactive diagrams. When it comes to multi-levelled complex system maps, users prefer to have the complete map presented on one big canvas instead of having individual pieces of the system separate, oversimplification and strict diagrammatic rules can hinder users in perceiving the information presented in a meaningful way.
- [Giga-Mapping: Visualisation for complexity and systems thinking in design](http://docplayer.net/41530820-Giga-mapping-visualisation-for-complexity-and-systems-thinking-in-design.html) - Describes giga-mapping method. A giga-map needs in its first phases only to communicate to its creators. The GIGA-map is regarded as a design artefact itself. This nested design process has proven to be very efficient in getting at grips at a higher level of complexity. Another way that GIGA-maps might differ is in the fact that they should layer many types of information. Interrelated categorically separated information. Multi scalar approach, from the global scale down to small details. 
- [Cartography Comparison, Google Maps & Apple Maps](https://www.justinobeirne.com/cartography-comparison) - An in-depth comparison of the design decisions of maps.

## Interface Ecology
- [The ecological approach to visual perception](https://daughtersofchaos.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/gibson_occluding-edge_1979.pdf)

## Systems

- [A Systems Literacy Manifesto](http://www.dubberly.com/articles/a-systems-literacy-manifesto.html)
- [An introduction to cybernetics](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/IntroCyb.pdf) - Some say it's the only real textbook on cybernetics
- [The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18554985-the-systems-view-of-life) - There is a fundamental unity to life, different living systems exhibit similar patterns of organization.
