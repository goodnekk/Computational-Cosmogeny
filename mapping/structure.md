## structure
The notion of structure is applicable and debatable in a lot of domains

Mathmatics can be seen as the study of [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure) in the formal sense.
Structure has usefull primitives such as: order, measure, metric, geometry and topology.

- list view
- spatial view
 - draw connection between objects by drawing lines between them, circling over them, selecting and press buttons
- every element is an object, eg: a text note, a drawing, an image, a map, etc
- to embed rich media on a plain text file, we use iA Writer’s [transclusion syntax](https://github.com/iainc/Markdown-Content-Blocks): `/name-of-file.ext`
- there is no editing and previewing panels? (could be a bad idea though)
- the database is a `json` file, which is mostly useful for searching, storing each object’s state (eg. connection with other objects) and filtering data, still each object stays on its own as a file in a big folder holding everything
- tags exists as inline `#tag` in a text note, and as field for images, audio and video files, etc
- are.na’s buckets exist in the form of filters and objects’s connection? translating this into the form of folders would fail pretty soon, so either we can use smart folders (cfr filters), or some sort of connection mechanism (maybe not only by drawing / connecting objects but also by the above inline `#tag` option
