# interface

There is a lot to draw from text-based interfaces; low-graphic interfaces; things like ported version of emacs with mixed up interfaces elements — imagine shiny retina display with elastic scrollbars, to what is essentially a bunch of text rectangles patched together. Emacs, unlike other text editors, has this quality of being a reactive text interface, eg. to update and mutate in real-time after the input a user has given.

Lately, many node.js based (electron-based) p2p ‘desktop’ apps have shown up, employing the same approach to interface design: solid, utilitarian, high-quality typography, interfaces.

It’s a sort of evolution from 90s button-heavy website design, to faux-texture based early 2000s internet, to app-like ‘this is a 2.0 forum’ websites, to graphic-design poster webpages (often constipated, often too sugary and euphoric of sleek-frivolous elements). And now, after a brief passage of brutal-%%%, which for the most part was not! there is this new flow of finally understood 90s button heavy interfaces, appreciated, dissected and redesigned.

Finally the mantra that websites are 95% typography, has evolved from being about print typography, to liberated typography for the architecture of the backlit screen (because also paper is a screen, we now know).
