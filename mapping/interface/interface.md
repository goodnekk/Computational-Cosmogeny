# interfaces

There is a lot to draw from text-based interfaces; low-graphic interfaces; things like ported version of emacs with mixed up interfaces elements — imagine shiny retina displays with elastic scrollbars, mixed with what is essentially a bunch of text rectangles patched together. Emacs, unlike other text editors, has this quality of being a reactive text interface, eg. to update and mutate in real-time after the input of a user.

Lately, many `node.js` based (electron-based) p2p ‘desktop’ apps have shown up, employing the same approach to interface design: solid, utilitarian, high-quality typographic, interfaces.

For example, [patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/blob/master/screenshot.jpg), an app for using the p2p gossip protocol [scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz).

These interfaces are a sort of evolution from the design of 90s button-heavy websites. Followed by faux texture-based early 2000s internet, to app-like ‘this is a 2.0 forum’ website, to graphic-design poster webpages (often constipated, often too sugary and euphoric of sleek-frivolous elements). 

And now, after a brief passage of brutal-%%%, which for the most part was not! there is this new flow of finally understood 90s button-heavy interfaces: appreciated, dissected and redesigned.

Finally the mantra that websites are 95% typography, has evolved from being about print typography, to liberated typography for the architecture of the backlit screen (because also paper is a screen, we know).

Notational Velocity perfectly fits into this area, as one of the best mix of GUI as if it were TUI. Keyboard-driven, essential to the core (a big search bar, an index, a preview pane), and with nifty features packed into what is an app that helps you staying in your thinking. As in, you start typing some half words, the index gets filtered through, you find what you need and start reading it, then you hide the app window by pressing two keys — done.

It is this kind of extension and almost total looking at the interface to the point that you are not really looking at it, because you know the keyboard combination, you are looking at the search results, and what care about is not the chrome in the moment, but keeping up wit the speed of your thoughts.

It seems paradoxical that now, some of these elements have been ported over web-technologies built desktop application, and still (somehow), being able to leave away all the constant vomit of the internet.

Conversely, just looks at Things.app (v3), too feel the smell of vomit slowly dripping down your screen as well as down your eyes. It’s far from being UI eye-candy, it’s a chewed up massive candy being licked all over your face.

In a way, there is a difference in graphic design between making books and making posters, and if you are working on an interface, you are working on a book rather than on a poster. But many (UI) designers wants to paint, rather than sketching / wireframing and leaving the lines open between each other. Things need to breath, not to stink.

The effect of 10 years of using macOS (nee Mac OS X), has been an immediate withdrawal and feeling prohibition from touching or even using the actual computer. Because it’s not that you really ‘use’ a painting. By starting messing with the terminal, I got back to feel I can play with things, with data, with applications, with my computers. And I ported that feeling back over to the rest of the OS.

(I’m stopping this nonsense here for now, there are a couple of things to keep, I feel it.)
