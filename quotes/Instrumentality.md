* > For critical posthumanism, the accelerated investment into intelligent machines has led to the formation of a posthuman subjectivity that acts without reasoning. This subjectivity has left behind reflective thinking and the slow pace of consciousness in favor of the immediacy of data correlation and the chain effects of fast decisions. *According to Hayles, this automated form of non-conscious intelligence involves the capacity of machines to solve complex problems without using formal languages or inferential deductive reasoning. However, rather than appealing to consciousness as the dividing line of human from machine cognition, Haylesâ€™ argument draws on a more general articulation of co-causal interactions across the non-conscious intelligences of animals, humans, and machines.* This extended vision of cognition enables a tripartite architecture of material processes (such as organic and artificial neural structures), non-conscious (such as non-reflexive or effect-led reasoning), and conscious (such as causal tracking, meta-reasoning, logical consequences) cognition. Whilst the materiality of process remains an inescapable starting point for thinking, the latter is not simply a tout court manifestation of these processes, but is mediated by a general activity of information-processing tasks, leading to outputs or results with the minimum effort of logical reasoning.
