# Conceptual Frameworks

In this document we define some conceptual frameworks that can guide our research and design.

## [The mess](https://www.are.na/marcel-wolkenmachine/the-global-mess)
* System of problems, where solutions cause other problems and problems are solutions.

## [Hypermapping](https://www.are.na/marcel-wolkenmachine/hyper-mapping)
* Cartography in non-euclidean space.

## [Systems Cartography](https://www.are.na/marcel-wolkenmachine/systems-cartography)
Cartography goes beyond diagrams, where multiple datasets and interpretations are put together into a coherent image, applied to complex systems.
* _briollage_: In cartography, maps are made by putting together multiple and incomplete data-sources which together create a whole picture.
* _unknowns_: Unknown areas are indicated by intentionally leaving blank areas, or by drawing imaginary creatures, or landscape features.
