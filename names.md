### Examples

* (URBIT) A personal server is a virtual computer which stores your data, runs your apps, and manages your connected devices. Urbit is a secure peer-to-peer network of personal servers, built on a clean-slate system software stack.
* Using the Dat Protocol, we are enhancing research & publishing tools with a data-first infrastructure.
* Are.na is a visual organization tool designed to help you think and create.
* (enoki) An experimental platform tool for peer-to-peer publishing 
* Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world

* (Plectica) We help people visualize & connect information so they can get on the same page—and move faster, together.
* (WorkFlowy) helps you break big ideas into manageable pieces, then focus on one piece at a time. 


### Attempts
* we _research new approaches to computers_ for _humans and non-humans_ so they can _think complex ecological thoughts_ ?
* it's like an _office suite_ but for _a totally different type of decentralised organization_ ? 
* it's a _thinking tool_ that augments the way we think
* we help you map and model complex problem spaces

## Core elements:
 * computation as representation
 * hypertext/rhizomes/assemblages v.s. ecology, nonlinear causal structures ("the mess")
