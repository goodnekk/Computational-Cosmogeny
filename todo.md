# computational cosmogony

note: i love github markdown todo’s syntax, it’s great. i began to extend it for my own needs some time ago, you can see it [here](https://github.com/afincato/tekken). but as i wasn’t making any quick progress in building the small js app to parse it, display it, and use it etc, i went back to org-mode for the time being.

question: should we stick with github markdown or flirt with an org-file hosted over github?
